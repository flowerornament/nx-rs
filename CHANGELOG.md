# Changelog

## v1.2.1 - 2026-03-16

- aligned the public and internal docs with the shipped Rust CLI surface and toolchain
- added CLI/spec anti-drift tests so `.agents/SPEC.md` stays in sync with clap metadata
- clarified internal `.agents` design notes as Rust-first guidance and marked historical material accordingly
- ignored the local `bd` credential artifact so tracker commands stop dirtying the worktree

This is a release-readiness and documentation hardening release. No intended end-user behavior changes.
